                    <h1>Geography</h1>
                    <p>Geographic Location and Area</p>
                </div>
            <p> Vigan, the capital town of Ilocos Sur is situated along the western coast of Northern Luzon. 
                It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Bantay; on the east by the municipality of Santa; 
                on the south by the municipality of Caoayan; on the west by the municipality of Sta. 
                Catalina and lastly, on the southwest by the China Sea. It is 408 kilometers from Manila; 
                80 km. from Laoag City and 139 km. from San Fernando, La Union. <br>

                <br> It has a total land area of 2,886.085 hectares or 28.86085 sq. km. 
                The heart of Vigan is located approximately between the meridian 120 23’15” 
                east longitude and the parallel 17 34’30” north latitude. <br>
                
                <br> Vigan has 39 barangays, the poblacion barangays consist of nine barangays, 
                with a total land area of 192.45 hectares  and the adjoining 30 barangays make 2,693.635 hectares.       
                </p>
                <h2>Topography</h2>
                <p>
                    The land area of Vigan is generally flat with slopes of 20 which are found at Brgy.V, Tamag, and Paoa. 
                    Out of the 2,886 hectares of the land area, 36.60% is residential and 45.18% is agricultural.
                    The drainage network of the eastern margin of Vigan-Bantay plain consist of deeply cut valleys whose pattern is strongly 
                    controlled by main faulting trends, particularly those in the northerly and easterly directions. <br> <br>

                    Vigan is being drained by the Vigan River and Bantay River, respectively, 
                    on the north and on the south by Mestizo River whose water discharge comes from Bantaoay head water.
                    The relief of Vigan-Bantay plain is actively level to undulating with a 
                    slope ranging from 0% to 8%. <br> <br>

                    Vigan in particular is generally level with several hills in Brgy. Tamag, 
                    Bulala and Salindeg, sometimes reaching about 50 meters in elevation and 
                    has a slope ranging from 3% to 8%. <br> <br>

                    The eastern margin of the plain characterized by a steep to a very steep slope, 
                    about 40% to 60%, the relief often reaches an elevation of more than 600 meters 
                    especially in the northerly and easterly portion. <br> <br>

                    The dominant topographic feature in the eastern margin of the town is the Vigan Gap 
                    Hill where the continuous shifting Vigan River cuts its way. The Gap Hill is located 
                    approximately 10 kilometers east of Vigan. <br> <br>
                </p>
                <h2>Surface Drainage</h2>
                <h2>The Mestizo River</h2>
                <p>
                    A sixteenth century map indicates that Vigan used to be completely surrounded by water that separated in from the mainland 
                    like a triangular-shaped island. Geological observation confirmed this, 
                    because the bodies of water surrounding Vigan were traced to have been the main channels then 
                    flowing in a westerly direction and branched as the river dissecting the Vigan ridge. <br><br>

                    At present, the Mestizo River is just a mere river draining Vigan. 
                    It is almost devoid of fish and is even at the verge of reaching intermittency. <br><br>

                    A brief study was carried out to gather preliminary geological information necessary 
                    for the plan of rejuvenating and developing the Mestizo River. <br><br>
                    The geologists of the National Museum estimated that from the mouth of the river 
                    to the bridge of Caoayan with a distance of about 2.5 kilometers long, with a width of 
                    90 meters and at a depth of 2 meters, the volume of sediments to be dredged is approximately 450,000 cubic meters <br>
                    <br>
